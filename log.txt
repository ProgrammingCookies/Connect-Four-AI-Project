Day 0 (2023-03-18)
 - created repository and readme
 
Day 1 (2023-03-19)
 - created functions for gameboard
 - created one game mode (2PlayerGame)
 
Day 2 (2023-03-25)
 - created initBoard function
 - decided on a naming convention
 - worked on fixing fourConnectedCheck

Day 3 (2023-03-26)
 - updated fourConnectedCheck through Git
 - started work with the neural network
 - began researching "one hot encoding"

Day 4
 - reworked input layer and the convolutional layer of the neural network
 - implemented one hot encoding
 - made the gameboard understandable for the neural network no matter which color it plays as
 - made it possible for 2 AI's to face eachother
 - made quitting possible
 - fixed some bugs
 
 Day 5
  - Did some small fixes
  - Create functions to initialize population and its offspring and made a function for competition between the neural networks. This competition function will be used as our fitness function.
  - Began implementing functions to visualize the neural networks while in training
